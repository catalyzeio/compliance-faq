# Does Catalyze help customers with audits and security reviews?

Yes, we readily and frequently assist customers with audits and security reviews. Both before and during our time at Catalyze, many of us have experienced the sometimes (often) painful process of a security review and / or audit. We’ve been asked the questions over and over and rarely confront questions and issues that we haven’t already addressed.

Whether it’s help completing a security questionnaire or having a call with a compliance officer, we’re here to help you navigate the path, be an expert in compliance, and turn HIPAA into an asset for your sales or internal team.

If you’re interested in help preparing or completing an audit or security review, please reach out to our [support department][1].

# Will Catalyze notify me in the case of a HIPAA breach?

Yes, per our [policies][2] and our BAA, we will notify you in a timely manner in the case of a breach of PHI. Our breach notification policies and internal procedures have been written and implemented specifically to address the concerns of compliance officers and mitigate the fallout risk from a breach.

# Does Catalyze review logs (application, database, network, IDS, etc)?

Yes, our security team reviews logs on a set schedule as defined by our policies.

- For our BaaS and HL7 customers, we review application, database, network, and IDS logs, in addition to vulnerability scan results.
- For our PaaS customers, we review network and IDS logs, in addition to vulnerability scan results.  

If you have questions specifically about log review, please reach out to our [security team][3] or review the specific policies [here][4], [here][5], [here][6], and [here][7].
