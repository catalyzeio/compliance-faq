# Does Datica address the administrative requirements of HIPAA?

Datica addresses all administrative requirements in the HIPAA rules through a fully implemented, audited, and HITRUST Certified information security management program (ISMP). One of the differentiators between Datica and other vendors offering “HIPAA-ready” hosting services is that Datica 1) addresses all of the technical requirements of HIPAA outside of the application level security and 2) we follow all requirements of HIPAA, not just the technical requirements, meaning we are the a fully HIPAA compliant platform vendor.

You can find the current version of the Datica ISMP [here][1].

# Who is the Datica Security Officer?

The current Datica Security Officer is Adam Leko (adam@datica.com). Adam oversees the technical aspects of HIPAA at Datica.

# How frequently does Datica conduct risk assessments?

We conduct full risk assessment based on a set schedule (currently annually) as well as with major changes to our technology or organization. An example of a major change was when we migrated one of our databases from Riak to Postgres.

Additionally, we conduct targeted risk assessments anytime we add application or database stacks to our [supported list][3] of technologies of our [Compliant Cloud][4].

Our [Risk Management Policy][5] details the process and tools we use to do risk assessments.
