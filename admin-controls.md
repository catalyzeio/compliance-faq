# Does Catalyze address the administrative requirements of HIPAA?

Catalyze addresses all administrative requirements in the HIPAA rules through a fully implemented, audited, and HITRUST Certified information security management program (ISMP). One of the differentiators between Catalyze and other vendors offering “HIPAA-ready” hosting services is that Catalyze 1) addresses all of the technical requirements of HIPAA outside of the application level security and 2) we follow all requirements of HIPAA, not just the technical requirements, meaning we are the a fully HIPAA compliant platform vendor.

You can find the current version of the Catalyze ISMP [here][1].

# Who is the Catalyze Security Officer?

The current Catalyze Security Officer is Adam Leko (adam@catalyze.io). Adam oversees the technical aspects of HIPAA at Catalyze.

In addition, Catalyze also has a Privacy Officer. The current Privacy Officer is Travis Good (travis@catalyze.io). Dr. Good oversees the administrative aspects of HIPAA at Catalyze.

To learn more about the Security and Privacy Officer roles at Catalyze, you can see our detailed descriptions [here][2].

# How frequently does Catalyze conduct risk assessments?

We conduct full risk assessment based on a set schedule (currently annually) as well as with major changes to our technology or organization. An example of a major change was when we migrated one of our databases from Riak to Postgres.

Additionally, we conduct targeted risk assessments anytime we add application or database stacks to our [supported list][3] of technologies of our [PaaS][4].

Our [Risk Management Policy][5] details the process and tools we use to do risk assessments.

# Are all Catalyze employees trained on HIPAA?

Yes, all of our employees undergo annual HIPAA training. If you’re interested in using our training at your organization, you can access it [here][6]. 

# Does Catalyze have subcontractors? How does that work?

Yes, Catalyze does leverage subcontractors for physical servers. In accordance with HIPAA, we have business associate agreements in place with all subcontracts. Our due diligence process for reviewing subcontractors is [here][7].
