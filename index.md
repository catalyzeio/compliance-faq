#Introduction

Welcome to the Catalyze Compliance FAQ. To the left you'll find frequently asked questions about how we address various aspects of HIPAA and HITRUST compliance. We've highlighted many of the topics that get covered during audits - either full audits from auditing firms or mini-audits from health systems and payers. Most health systems and payers ask different questions, using different wording and formats, but are looking for similar responses.

If you can't find the question you're looking for we encourage you to add it to our open source repository located [here](https://github.com/catalyzeio/compliance-faq).

If you have any other issues feel free to send us and email at [hipaa@catalyze.io](mailto:hipaa@catalyze.io).
