# What is the difference between HIPAA and HITRUST?

HIPAA was written by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a part of the federal government. There are financial, and potentially legal, penalties, if breaches occur and organizations are found to be out of compliance. HIPAA is enforced by the Office of Civil Rights at HHS. There is no **HIPAA certification**, instead organizations like Catalyze typically undergo 3rd party audits to prove compliance with HIPAA.

HITRUST was created by the healthcare industry, specifically large entities like United Health and CVS Caremark. It is an effort to create a PCI-like certification for healthcare data. There is an organization called HITRUST, based in Texas, that oversees the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) and manages the web tool used to attest compliance with the CSF. Organizations can choose to self assess against the CSF or be validated by a third party auditor, which is the only way to achieve HITRUST Certification. Catalyze has been validated by a 3rd party auditor and is HITRUST Certified.
